# Orographic regions
A shapefile of orographic regions, currently limited to High Mountain Asia.

The project aims to provide meaningful, local region names and region boundaries that facilitate comparative analyses of specific characteristics regarding e.g. climate, hydrology or topography.

For the sake of brevity, parts of region labels that mean 'mountain range' or similar are excluded from region labels. For example, the 'Kun Lun Shan' is labled 'Kun Lun', here.
